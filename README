Description: Scroll to Top Button allows you to quickly jump back to the top of any page! Once you scroll far enough down on a page, the button will appear in the top right corner. Click it, and you will be taken to the very top in no time!

Great for when viewing long/infinite pages such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.

Inspired by the Tumblr Dashboard!
